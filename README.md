# Test-train-test: Linguistics


For the purpose of this test experiment , I am dealing with just two sounds. Yes.mp3 and No.mp3. The user must decide whether two sounds played are the same. After the first initial testing period, the user is trained on the difference between the two sounds using images. Finally, the user is tested again one last time on the sounds, to see if visual association resulted in increased cognitive ability regarding the different vocal stimuli.
